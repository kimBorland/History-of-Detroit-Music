<!--<h1>Kick out the Jams!</h1> 

<p>“Get up! Everybody’s gonna move their feet. Get down! Everybody’s gonna leave their seats. You gotta lose your mind in Detroit Rock City.” The chorus lyrics of the song by Kiss, who is not a band from Detroit describe a young man who is so excited to get to Detroit for a Kiss concert that he is killed in a car accident while driving under the influence. Although the subject of the song is quite somber in nature, the excitement of the young man is dead-on and mirror the excitement that surrounds the city of Detroit and its musicians. It’s a city with heart and soul, a city with abounding and undeniable talent, and a city with so many stories.</p>
<p>Detroit is arguably one of the most talent-rich cities in the world and has had as much 
influence on the music industry as any of the other heavy-hitters, such as New York, 
L.A., or Manchester, England. Over the decades, Detroit has gone through many musical transformations. </p>
<p>Detroit had a significant impact on the Jazz Age of music in the roaring twenties. Top Blues and Jazz performers and big bands flocked to the area known as “Black Bottom” to play the famous Paradise Valley entertainment district. In the 1940’s, Jazz gave way to the Blues, notably, John Lee Hooker, who came to Detroit to work at Ford Motor Company. Hooker felt right at home with the variety of Blues clubs that lined Hastings Street.</p>
<p>Detroit is the birthplace of two entire genres of music, Motown and Techno, that greatly impacted other musicians in these areas in the rest of the world. Smokey Robinson and the Miracles and the Supremes lead the way for Motown. Decades later, a trio of friends from Belleville, Juan Atkins, Derrick May and Kevin Saunderson would start the electronic music era known as techno.</p>
<p>Many rock legends, whose careers have spanned decades like Ted Nugent, Bob Seger and Alice Cooper hail from Detroit. And since Rock and Roll never dies, it was reborn. “Garage rockers” from Detroit reinvented the rock sound for a new day. The likes of The White Stripes, Sponge and The Von Bondies became hometown favorites who attained great success elsewhere. </p>
<p>Punk lest not be forgot on Detroit either. Bands like the MC5, and The Stooges rose up in the late 1960’s, leading the way for later punk rock bands. Hip Hop Artists Eminem and Kid Rock, who came from humble beginnings always write lyrics about their love for the city from which they came. To quote Eminem, “ I can never turn my back on a city that made me.”</p>
<p>The greatest thing about Detroit music is that it is as culturally diverse as its people. There’s something for everybody. It’s sound is entertaining, gritty, and it has heart. So here’s to the Music of Motown, the artists who entertain, the culture surrounding the music of the city, and the fans who love it. </p>
